:section: Develop with Neo4j

.Goals
[abstract]
You can use Neo4j with a lot of different programming languages. Here we provide an introduction and a consistent example application with several languages and Neo4j drivers. +
This section explains the basic concepts for interacting with Neo4j and explains the sample Movie Application.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:../../what-is-neo4j/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model. You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:../../cypher-query-language[Cypher Query language]. And you should have whatever you need for development with your stack up and running.

=== Connecting to Neo4j

You probably also wonder how you would connect from your programming language to a Neo4j Database?
If you've installed and started Neo4j as a server on your system, you can interact with the database with the built-in Neo4j browser application.

If you want to access Neo4j programmatically, you can do so with one of the many integrated HTTP-APIs, which allow you to:

* POST one or more cypher statements with parameters per request to the server
* Keep transactions open over multiple requests
* Choose different result formats

The simplest HTTP request would look like:

[source,json]
----
curl -i -H accept:application/json -H content-type:application/json \
-XPOST http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit \
  -d '{"statements":[{"statement":"CREATE (p:Person {name:{name}}) RETURN p",
       "parameters":{"name":"Daniel"}}]}'

{"results":[{"columns":["p"],"data":[{"row":[{"name":"Daniel"}]}]}],"errors":[]}
----

In most cases you don't want to connect to Neo4j manually but you a driver or connector library for your stack or programming language.
Thanks to the Neo4j community, there are drivers for Neo4j for almost every popular programming language, most of which mimic existing database driver idioms and approaches.

=== Neo4j for Haskell Developers

haskell-cypher makes it easy to send cypher commands to neo4j servers over their REST API. 
Additionally, it allows users to parse haskell datatypes from cypher queries.
