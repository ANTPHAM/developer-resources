.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a JavaScript developer, this guide provides an overview of options for connecting to Neo4j.
While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different Drivers and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model.
You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:/developer/cypher[Cypher Query language].

=== Neo4j for JavaScript Developers

image::http://dev.assets.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/nodejs.png[]

The standalone Neo4j-Server can be installed on any machine and then accessed via its HTTP API. 

Below we show how you can use something as simple as the `request` module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.

You can also choose to leverage one of the existing drivers for Neo4j which wrap that protocol in a more convenient API for you.
// end::intro[]

Follow the tips below to get you started.

include::../_includes/sample_project.adoc[]

=== Using the HTTP-Endpoint directly

You can use something as simple as the `request` node-module to send queries to and receive responses from Neo4j.
The endpoint protocol and formats are explained in detail in the {manual}/rest-api-transactional.html[Neo4j Manual].
It enables you do to much more, e.g. sending many statements per request or keeping transactions open across multiple requests.

Here is a very simple example:

.Simple Function Accessing the Remote Endpoint
[source,javascript]
----
var r=require("request");
var txUrl = "http://localhost:7474/db/data/transaction/commit";
function cypher(query,params,cb) { 
  r.post({uri:txUrl,
          json:{statements:[{statement:query,parameters:params}]}},
         function(err,res) { cb(err,res.body)}) 
}
----

.Running the Function
[source,javascript]
---- 
var query="MATCH (n:User) RETURN n, labels(n) as l LIMIT {limit}"
var params={limit: 10}
var cb=function(err,data) { console.log(JSON.stringify(data)) }
 
cypher(query,params,cb)
 
{"results":[
  {"columns":["n","l"],
   "data":[
     {"row":[{"name":"Aran"},["User"]]}
    ]
  }],
 "errors":[]}

[[node-neo4j]]
=== node-neo4j (Thingdom)

Most widely used Node.js driver for Neo4j.
This driver aims to be the most robust, comprehensive, and battle-tested driver available. It's run in production by https://www.fiftythree.com/[FiftyThree] to power https://www.fiftythree.com/paper[Paper] and https://mix.fiftythree.com/[Mix].

==== Features

* Cypher queries, parameters, batching, and transactions
* Arbitrary HTTP requests, for custom Neo4j plugins
* Custom headers, for high availability, application tracing, query logging, and more
* Precise errors, for robust error handling from the start
* Configurable connection pooling, for performance tuning & monitoring
* Thorough test coverage with >100 tests
* Continuously integrated against multiple versions of Node.js and Neo4j

=== cypher-stream

Neo4j cypher queries as node object streams.

Transactions are duplex streams that allow you to write query statements then commit or roll back the written queries.

To get a stream per statement, just pass a callback function with the statement object. 
This works for regular cypher calls and transactions.

=== Seraph

*Seraph* is a comprehensive, well documented driver for Neo4j, which supports all Neo4j features and provides not only Neo4j connection support, but extensive lifecycle handling.
The additional extensions *seraph-model* and *seraph-resource* allow you to quickly load and persist your models and integrate seraph-model resolution into your express routes with a base-controller for CRUD operations.
With *disposable-seraph* you can manage a disposable Neo4j-instance for automatic testing.

=== simple-neo4j

This is a simple neo4j pure javascript database driver. 
It takes in one or more queries, commits them to the database in a single transaction, and parses the database result into a simple and easy native javascript object, of course the parser can be disabled if desired.

https://tonicdev.com/npm/simple-neo4j[Test simple-neo4j in your Browser]


[source,javascript]
----
simpleNeo4J.execute('MATCH (n:Movie) RETURN count(*)')
    .then(function(result)
    {
        result.firstValue === 26;
    });

== Meteor.js 

image::https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Meteor-logo.png[width=200]
http://meteor.com[Meteor] is a complete open source platform for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript.

=== ccorcos:neo4j

Chet and Sam Corcos created the `ccorcos:neo4j` package that integrates Meteor well with Neo4j including reactivity and query-reevaluation on data changes.

Both wrote and presented about it and Chet provided insight into an example application for event feeds, written with Meteor and Neo4j as a stack.

A Neo4j driver for Dart. Both a simple driver and an OGM (Object Graph Mapper) is provided in separate libraries.

////
.Example
[source,dart]
----
import 'package:neo4j_dart/neo4j_dart.dart';

main() async {
  var db = new Neo4j();
  var result = await db.cypher('''
        Create (dart:Language {dart})-[:connects_to]->(neo4j:Database {neo4j})
        Return id(dart), id(neo4j)
      ''', {
        'dart': { 'name': 'Dart' },
        'neo4j': { 'name': 'Neo4j' },
      });

  print('successfully created two nodes with id ${result['data'][0]['row'].join(' and ')}');
}
