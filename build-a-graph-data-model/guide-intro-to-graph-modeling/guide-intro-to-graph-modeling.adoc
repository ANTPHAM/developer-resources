.Goals
[abstract]
We live in a connected world. There are no isolated pieces of information, but rich, connected domains all around us.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
Nodes can be tagged with zero to many labels representing their different roles in the domain. In addition to contextualizing node and relationship properties, labels may also serve to attach metadata--index or constraint information, for example--to nodes.

This guide will show you how to design a graph model and you can then apply the lessons to your own data set. We'll be following Ian Robinson's *Design for Queryability* modeling approach.

The creation of a graph model should be treated as an iterative process--we don't need to come up with the perfect model on our first try.

=== Application/End User Goals

As designing a graph model fits easily into an Agile development approach, we'd typically start with link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story[Agile stories].

For example, if we're building an application that will recommend colleagues we should work with based on similar skills, we might start out with the following story:
____
As an employee +
I want to know who in the company has similar skills as me +
So that we can exchange knowledge

=== Questions to ask of the domain

We can restructure that into the following question:

____
Which people, who work for the same company as me, have similar skills as me?
____

Now that we've got our first question, we can come up with a model.

=== Identity entities

The first thing we need to do is identify entities or nouns. These will become the nodes in our model. e.g.

____
Which *people*, who work for the same *company* as me, have similar *skills* as me? +
 +
person +
company +
skill
____

=== Identity relationships

The next step is to pull out the relationships between those entities which we can do by pulling out the verbs:

____
Which people, who *work for* the same company as me, *have* similar skills as me? +
 +
person WORKS_FOR company +
person HAS_SKILL skill +
____

During this process, it's helpful to have a whiteboard handy on which you can easily brainstorm with colleagues on the model. In addition, using actual data rather than the type names tends to make system properties easier to grasp.

WIth actual data, our model might look like this:

As we come up with new questions and associated queries we can repeat this process. 

Although models used in production are much more complex than this simple example, keeping in mind that a good model is made up of both components that are both necessary and sufficient. In other words, although our model has to be detailed enough answer our questions, we don't need to model every detail of the system in question.

The following resources contain examples of models that others have come up with to answer the questions they had of their data:
