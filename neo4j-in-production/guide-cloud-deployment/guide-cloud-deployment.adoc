.Goals
[abstract]
This guide highlights the different options for setting up Neo4j in the cloud.
It includes setting up a template on EC2 on AWS, explain the setup on Azure, and introduce the different Neo4j cloud-hosting partners.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should know how to run and operate Neo4j locally. 
Knowledge of remote drivers to access Neo4j from your application helps you connect to your cloud-hosted database. 
For self-service hosting you should bring along enough sysops experience that a Linux system doesn't freak you out.

=== Hosting on AWS / EC2

We provide an https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-puppet/blob/master/README.CLOUDFORMATION.md[*EC2 Cloud Formation Template*] that allows you to quickly provision an appropriate instance and install and set-up Neo4j on that machine.

This template creates a complete Neo4j installation, including Amazon AWS server, fixed IP address and backup storage. 
It's intended to help application developers get up and running quickly with Neo4j without in-depth experience of Linux servers, AWS, or installing databases like Neo4j.


If you are proficient at setting up AWS instances, you can also install Neo4j on any provisioned Linux instance

=== Windows Azure

It gets easier to deploy Neo4j Server on Azure every day, so here you can find some step-by-step instructions and hints on how to achieve that.

Neo4j installation on Windows Azure can be provisioned through the VMDepot Image or by provisioning Linux instances and then running any of the provisioning scripts you'd like.

=== Neo4j Cloud Hosting Providers

There are a number of Neo4j partners that provide hosting of Neo4j instances in the cloud.
