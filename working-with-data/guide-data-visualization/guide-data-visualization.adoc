Graph visualisations are a powerful tool to convey the content of a graph.
They can highlight patterns, show clusters and connections.
There are many excellent options for graph visualization, such as http://d3js.org/[the D3.js], http://threejs.org/[three.js] and http://sigmajs.org/[sigma.js].
In all cases, the visualizer request JSON data for all or a part of the graph data then dynamically creates an in-memory JavaScript visualization on the client side.

A few of the more popular graph-visualization methods are discussed below.

=== The Neo4j Browser

The default http://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j Server] has a powerful, customizable data visualization tool based on the built-in D3.js library.
In the following video, we demonstrate how to style nodes and relationships in the Neo4j's Browser visualization, and how to set colors, sizes, and titles.
We then discuss the Graph-Style-Sheet (GRASS) and how you can download, update, and reset the styling information.

KeyLines is an out-of-the-box JavaScript solution for visualizing networks.
It works in all major browsers and all platforms, including the iPad.

KeyLines integrates into existing web applications easily and with very little effort.
How and where you get the data is up to you.
KeyLines does the job of rendering it and responding to user interactions like clicking, touching, moving nodes, and more.
You bind to these events to customize what happens, and, most importantly, your data stays under your control at all times: KeyLines is self-contained and needs no external connections.
