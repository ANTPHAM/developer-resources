## Neo4j Developer Resources

Contains guides in asciidoc format, rendered with asciidoctor into HTML and pushed to the single gh-pages branch,
use the `render.sh` script to do that.

We use the template defined in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neo4j-contrib/developer-resources/gh-pages/guide_template.adoc[guide_template.adoc] for the guide structure, which is rendered like http://neo4j-contrib.github.io/developer-resources/guide_template.html[this]-

The HTML page uses jquery ajax to query 3 REST-Endpoints in the backend for `/search`, `/movie` and `/graph`
