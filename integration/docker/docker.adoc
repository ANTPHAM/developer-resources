.Goals
[abstract]
This overview demonstrates several ways of utilizing Docker containers to run Neo4j instances or integrate them into a bigger setup. Detailed instructions are available at the linked repositories, which we don't want to duplicate here.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a sound understanding of both Docker and Neo4j, to leverage them effectively together.

== General Observations

http://docker.com[Docker] is a lightweight virtualization mechanism to run single applications containerized and restricted on your machine.
Docker images are pre-build in layers from configuration of services one of which would be Neo.
They are built using a simple textual description that describes one layer.
A docker image can be started immediately after downloading, no time-consuming boot required.

There are many ways to leverage Docker for your Neo4j deployment.
You can create throwaway Neo4j instances of many different versions for testing and running your applications.
You can pre-seed containers with datasets and configurations.

Conflicting port and disk usage can be handled by mapping ports and volumes of multiple instances of the same container to different on the host system.
Docker containers can be used as infrastructure layer, data containers or configuration providers.

== Existing Docker Containers

In the Neo4j community and ecosystem a number of containers for Neo4j have been developed, both for running individual instances, for setting up Neo4j Enterprise clusters easily and for providing integration with other tools and services.
Here we want to list some of those examples to either be used directly or as inspiration for your own needs.

== Neo4j Containers

It is easy to create a Neo4j image yourself, just any base linux container with a JDK is good enough.
Just add Neo4j (e.g. the debian package) on top and you're done. 

There are already a number of https://registry.hub.docker.com/search?q=neo4j[Docker Neo4j images] available on Docker Hub.

Make sure when running the docker image to expose the Neo4j port `7474` and provide the database directory as external volume. E.g.

`docker run -i -t -d â€“privileged -v /home/user/neo4jdata:/var/lib/neo4j/data -p 7474:7474 tpires/neo4j`

Some of the more widely used images:

* https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/kbastani/docker-neo4j/[latest Neo4j by Kenny Bastani]
* https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/tpires/neo4j/[Neo4j 2.1.x by tpires]

== Neo4j Enterprise Cluster

Our partner Ekino developed a container setup and script that allows you to spin up a Neo4j enterprise cluster quickly just with a bit of config and a single command line call, if you are on linux :

[source,shell]
----
# start a neo4j cluster w/ 3 nodes
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekino/docker-neo4j-cluster/master/helper.sh | bash -s run:neomaster,neoreadslave,neobackup
----

The latest version is available in ekino's https://github.com/ekino/docker-neo4j-cluster[GitHub repository].
Please see the project documentation for more details.

== Neo4j - Spark - Analytics

As part of the link:../apache-spark#mazerunner[Apache Spark integration] for Neo4j-Mazerunner a default setup is provided by Kenny Bastani to install Spark, Hadoop, RabbitMQ and Neo4j with the Mazerunner extension using Docker.
