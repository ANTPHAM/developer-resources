.Goals
[abstract]
If you are a Pythonista, you should find enough information to get you started with Neo4j. While this guide is not comprehensive it will introduce the different drivers and link to the relevant resources.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should be familiar with link:../../what-is-neo4j/graph-database[graph database concepts] and the property graph model. You should have link:/download[installed Neo4j] and made yourself familiar with our link:../../cypher-query-language[Cypher Query language].

=== Neo4j from Python

image::http://dev.assets.neo4j.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png[width=300]

Python is an excellent dynamic language, and we're proud to say that Neo4j works well it.
Python drivers were there all from the beginning and a strong and driving force for adopting Neo4j in many places.

Drivers for the different Python stacks enable you to use Neo4j from your familiar environment.
// end::intro[]

Many Pythonistas have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so please if you use them provide feedback to the authors. 

include::../_includes/sample_project.adoc[]

Python and Neo4j are a well established combination, mainly thanks to the many contributors in the community.

For small apps it’s feasible to connect directly to Neo4j and execute the Cypher queries that you need to. 
We also have Django support for building bigger web applications, in Neo4jDjango and Neomodel.

// There’s also the community-supported python-embedded, which uses JPype and JNI to embed a JVM in your Python app; that lets you drive our core API from Python.

==== Getting Started

This excellent article from Nigel demonstrates how to join in the fun.
