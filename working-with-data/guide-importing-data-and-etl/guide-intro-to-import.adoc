.Goals
[abstract]
Existing data comes in many shapes and sizes and one of the most popular is a relational database. In this guide we'll look at how we can export a Postgres data set into Neo4j.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have a basic understanding of the link:/what-is-neo4j/property-graph[property graph model] and have completed the link:../../build-a-graph-data-model/guide-intro-to-graph-modeling/index.html[modeling guide]. Having link:/download[downloaded] and installed Neo4j server helps you code along with the examples.

In this guide we'll be using the link:https://code.google.com/p/northwindextended/downloads/detail?name=northwind.postgre.sql&can=2&q=[NorthWind data set] as our example. NorthWind is a popular data set used to demonstrate SQL and relational databases but the data is graphy enough to be interesting for us.

The following is an entity relationship diagram of the data set:

There are a couple of rules of thumbs when deriving a graph model from a relational one which we can use to come up with our first cut:

* A row is a node
* A table name is a label name

For this data set the following graph model serves as a first iteration:

<insert image of model here>

= How does it differ to the relational model?

* Graph should be more normalised. e.g. addresses have been denormalised in the Suppliers, Orders, Customers and Employees table
* No nulls in the graph model - in the relational one to track the employee hierarchy we have a null enttry in the 'ReportsTo' column if they don't report to anybody

Now that we know what we'd like our graph to look like we need to extract the data from Postgres so we can create it. The easiest way to do that is to export the appropriate tables in CSV format. Postgres' 'copy' command lets us execute a SQL query and write the result to a CSV file:



[source, sql]
----
Copy (SELECT * FROM orders
      left outer join customers ON customers."CustomerID" = orders."CustomerID"
      left outer join employees ON employees."EmployeeID" = orders."EmployeeID"
      left outer join order_details ON order_details."OrderID" = orders."OrderID"
      left outer join products ON products."ProductID" = order_details."ProductID"
      left outer join suppliers ON suppliers."SupplierID" = products."SupplierID"
      left outer join categories ON categories."CategoryID" = products."CategoryID")
      To '/tmp/customerDb.csv' With CSV header;
----

Next we'll create some indexes on the (label, property) pairs that we're going to create in Neo4j.

[source, cypher]
----
create index on :Product(productId)
----

[source, cypher]
----
create index on :Category(categoryId)
----

[source, cypher]
----
create index on :Order(OrderId)
----

[source, cypher]
----
create index on :Employee(employeeId)
----

[source, cypher]
----
create index on :Supplier(supplierId)
----

After we've done that we'll use Cypher's link:http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/query-load-csv.html[LOAD CSV] command to transform the contents of the CSV file into a graph structure.

[source, cypher]
----
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:/tmp/customerDb.csv" AS row

MERGE (order:Order {orderId: row.OrderID})

MERGE (product:Product {productId: row.ProductID})
ON CREATE SET product.name = row.ProductName

MERGE (supplier:Supplier {supplierId: row.SupplierID})
ON CREATE SET supplier.companyName = row.SupplierCompanyName

MERGE (employee:Employee {employeeId: row.EmployeeID})

MERGE (category:Category {categoryId: row.CategoryID})
ON CREATE SET category.name = row.CategoryName

MERGE (employee)-[:SOLD]->(order)
MERGE (order)-[:PRODUCT]->(product)
MERGE (supplier)-[:SUPPLIES]->(product)
MERGE (product)-[:PART_OF]->(category)
----



We can now query the graph...
