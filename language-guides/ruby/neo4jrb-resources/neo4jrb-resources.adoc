=== Importing data

There are many ways to import your existing data depending on how it is currently structured

 * link:http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/query-load-csv.html[**LOAD CSV**] is a clause built into Cypher which allows you to build your own import scripts
 * link:http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/import-tool.html[**neo4j-import**] is a binary command which comes with Neo4j and which takes files in a specific CSV format to import data very quickly
 * link:https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4apis-activerecord[**neo4apis-activerecord**] is a good choice if you already have a project using `ActiveRecord`.  However it also works to import an existing SQL database even if you don't have any models defined

Get more information on our link:/developer/working-with-data/[Working With Data] page.

// Seeding / Migrations?

// Should we do a choose-your-own-adventure sort of thing?  If somebody has an existing app they probably want a different guide from somebody starting from scratch (also if they have Neo4j already or not)

=== The Neo4j.rb Project

Using the Neo4j.rb project you can connect to a remote Neo4j server with any implementation of Ruby or use JRuby to take advantage of Neo4j's Java APIs directly.

=== Setup


==== Ruby Web Application Frameworks

There is a link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5klM3mD6alLUhNTPTbj5a3GBjU7oZN0t[Neo4j.rb screencast series] which shows how to use Neo4j in a Ruby on Rails application.  Much of the material is also applicable in any Ruby application.

You can view sample application repositories for different frameworks below:
