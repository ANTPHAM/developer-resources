Please have link:/download[Neo4j downloaded] and unzipped. It helps if you read the section on link:/developer/get-started/graph-database[Graph Databases].

== Installing and Starting Neo4j Browser

First, http://neo4j.org/download[download] and unzip Neo4j, change into the new directory and start the server.
If you have a JDK (Java7) installed and executed `bin/neo4j start` from there, you should see the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd neo4j-community-2.2.1
$ bin/neo4j start

Starting Neo4j Server...WARNING: not changing user
process [70299]... waiting for server to be ready...... OK.
http://localhost:7474/ is ready.
----

****
If you connect to Neo4j for the first time, you're asked to change the password for the default user account "neo4j/neo4j".

[NOTE]
Please remember the password. 
In case you forget it, you have to remove the credentials file in `data/dbms/authorization`.
****

Open the URL http://localhost:7474 to start working with Neo4j and our query language, link:/developer/cypher[Cypher].

If you want to learn more first, click on any of the helpful links shown after startup: these are quick guides that introduce the different concepts.

* **Intro** - a guided tour `:play intro`
* **Concepts** - GraphDB 101 `:play concepts`
* **Cypher** - query language `:play cypher`
* **The Movie Graph** - a mini graph model with use-cases `:play movie graph`
* **The Northwind Database** - the classic database demo import & use-cases `:play northwind graph`

Import sample data by entering `:play movies`, selecting the large Cypher +CREATE ...+ statement, then hitting the `Run` button.

After a few seconds the data is imported, and we'll see a subset of the movie graph rendered for us.

== Styling Neo4j Browser Visualization

The nodes already have a sensible titles, this is new since Neo4j 2.2, it auto-selects a property from the property list to be rendered as label.

If you click on any node or relationship you see the properties of that element below the visualization, larger property sets might be folded in, there is a little arrow on the right to fold them out.

E.g. you click on one of the Movies then you can see it's properties below the graph. 
Same for actors or the `ACTED_IN` relationships.

If you click on any label or relationship above the graph visualization, you can then select the styling in the area below the graph.

Colors, sizes and titles are selectable from there.

For instance click on the `(Movies)` label above the graph and change the color, size and title of nodes labeled with `Movie`.

=== Advanced Styling 

For more advanced styling you can bring up the style-viewer with `:style`, download the graph-style-sheet (GRASS), edit it offline and drag it back onto the drag-area of the viewer.

Within the GRASS file you can change colors, fonts, sizes, outlines and titles per node-label and relationship-type.
It is also possible to combine multiple properties into a caption with `caption: '{name} of <type>';`

You can also *reset all styling* by clicking the "fire extinguisher" icon.

== Queries and Favorites

If you start with an empty frame, display some nodes and relationships, use the Favorites (Star) tab on the left, click on the **Get Some Data** entry, and run the query.
This executes the statement `MATCH (n) RETURN n limit 100` which fetches some nodes. 

The browser also fetches and displays relationships between those nodes, even if they were not part of your query result.
You can disable the latter behavior with the "Auto-Complete" switch in the bottom left corner.
Then only relationships returned by the query will be shown.

You can save your own queries as favorites by "starring" them. 
Use folders to organize the favorites.

== Some Tips and Tricks for Neo4j Browser

Executing Queries & Commands

* switch to multi-line editing mode with `shift+enter`, then `enter` will create newlines
* execute with `ctrl+enter`
* you can click on the query text above the output pane and it is added to the editor again
* navigate history with `ctrl+up` and `ctrl+down`, the history will be persisted across browser restarts
* `ESC` puts the editor in fullscreen mode, good for large queries
* You can switch between tabular, visual mode and query plan mode for results with the icons on the left of each panel, 
** don't worry if you don't see any output, you might just be in visual mode but returned tabular/scalar data, just switch the mode to tabular
** query time is reported in the tabular view, but it is not the correct minimal time for your query, as the browser makes several requests and roundtrips to fetch the data
** you can download the results as CSV from the tabular output panel (top right download icon), and as JSON (download icon above the panel)
* `:clear` removes all accumulated output panels, the trashcan icon removes a single panel and the cross expands a panel into fullscreen (helpful in visual mode)

Favorites

* if you want to save a snippet to your favorites (using the star button), make sure to add a comment line on top (`// ...`) which will be used as title for your snipppet
* you can group your favorites into folders and order them with drag and drop and remove them again

Configuration

* you can retrieve the current configuration with `:config`
* the individual settings are configured with:
** `:config maxNeighbours:100` - maxiumum number of neighbours for a node
** `:config maxNodes:1000` - maximum number of nodes for the visualization
** `:config maxNodes:1000` - maximum number of rows for the tabular result


=== Executing REST requests

You can also execute REST requests with the Neo4j Browser, the command-syntax is +
`:COMMAND /a/path {"some":"data"}`.
The available commands are `:GET`, `:POST`, `:PUT` and `:DELETE`.
A simple query would inspect the available endpoints of the database `:GET /db/data/`, the results are listed as formatted JSON.
Then you can for instance retrieve all labels in the database with `:GET /db/data/labels`.

To execute a Cypher statement you post to the transaction Cypher endpoint like this:

[source,javascript]
----
:POST /db/data/transaction/commit {"statements":[
     {"statement":"MATCH (m:Movie) WHERE m.title={title} RETURN m.title, m.released, labels(m)",
      "parameters":{"title":"Cloud Atlas"}}]}
