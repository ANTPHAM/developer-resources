Neo4j might be developed in Java, but don't assume that you need to use a Java client. 
PHP drivers came along quite early and have enabled many interesting use-cases for Neo4j.

There’s a number of of ways to access Neo4j from PHP.
Drivers for the different PHP stacks enable you to use Neo4j from your familiar environment.

Members of the PHP community have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so please if you use them provide feedback to the authors.

Neo4jPHP provides an API that is both intuitive and flexible, and it takes advantage of ‘under-the -hood’ performance enhancements, such as caching and lazy-loading.

This is a PHP Data Objects driver for the Neo4j graph database, it allows you to connect to a Neo4j server from PHP using the standard PDO API. The project currently only implements a “vanilla” PHP implementation, which means you need to use a special constructor to create your PDO connection. PHP extensions to register the driver with PDO in HHVM and Zend VM are planned future wor

A PHP adapter for Neo4j ReST API cypher endpoint. PHP Cypher aims to take the pain out of sending cypher query to Neo4j server. I believe that cypher will be a major part of Neo4j in near future. In short, this library focus solely on sending query to Neo4j database. For those looking for adapter on all the Neo4j ReST API can try this great library.
