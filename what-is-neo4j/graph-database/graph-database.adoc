== What is a graph database?

A graph database stores records in the shape of a mathematical graph.

== Core concepts

A graph database can store any kind of data using a few simple concepts

* Nodes – graph data records
* Relationships – connect nodes
* Properties – named data values
* Labels - associate sets of nodes

== A Graph Database

Neo4j stores data in a Graph, with records called Nodes.


== Create a node

The simplest graph has just a single node with some named values called Properties. Let’s draw a social graph of our friends on the Neo4j team:

. Start by drawing a circle for the node
. Add the name Emil
. Note that he is from Sweden

[TIP]
====
* Nodes are the name for data records in a graph
* Data is stored as Properties
* Properties are simple name/value pairs
====

== Add a Label

Labels associate a set of nodes.

Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member. In our social graph, we’ll label each node that represents a Person.

. Apply the label “Person” to the node we created for Emil
. Color “Person” nodes red

[TIP]
====
* A node can have zero or more labels
* Labels do not have any properties
* Labeled Node
* More Nodes
* Schema-free, nodes can have a mix of common and unique properties.
====

== More Nodes

Like any database, storing data in Neo4j can be as simple as adding more records. We’ll add a few more nodes, representing the following facts:

. Emil has a klout score of 99
. Johan, from Sweden, who is learning to surf
. Ian, from England, who is an author
. Rik, from Belgium, has a cat named Orval
. Allison, from California, who surfs

[TIP]
====
* Similar nodes can have different properties
* Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans
* Neo4j can store billions of nodes
====

== Consider Relationships

Relationships connect nodes in the graph.

The real power of Neo4j is in connected data. To associate any two nodes, add a Relationship which describes how the records are related.

In our social graph, we simply say who KNOWS whom:

. Emil KNOWS Johan and Ian
. Johan KNOWS Ian and Rik
. Rik and Ian KNOWS Allison

[TIP]
====
* Relationships always have direction
* Relationships always have a type
* Relationships form patterns of data relationships
* Relationship properties
* Relationship properties store information shared by two nodes.
====

== Relationship properties

Relationships properties store information describing the relationship between two nodes.

In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also contain properties. Looking more closely at Emil’s relationships, note that:

Emil has known Johan since 2001
Emil rates Ian 5 (out of 5)
Everyone else can have similar relationship properties
