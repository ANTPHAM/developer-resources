Storing a graph is one thing, but visualization creates awe and epiphanies.
Graph visualisations are a powerful tool to convey the content of a graph.
They can highlight patterns, show clusters and connections. There are different tools that you can use to visualize the content of a Neo4j graph database.

A popular choice are JavaScript frameworks such as http://d3js.org/[the D3.js], http://threejs.org/[three.js] and http://sigmajs.org/[sigma.js].
In all cases, the technique is to request JSON data for all or a part of the graph data from the server backend, and then dynamically add this data to the JavaScript visualization in-memory model for rendering on the client side.

There are a great number of ways to show and manipulate graph data, below are listed a few of the more popular ones.

=== The Neo4j Browser

The default http://neo4j.com/download[Neo4j Server] has a powerful, customizable data visualization tool based on the D3.js library built in.
In the following video, Michael shows how to style Nodes and Relationships in the Neo4j's Browser visualization, and how to set colors, sizes, and titles.
He discusses the Graph-Style-Sheet (GRASS) and how you can download, update, and reset the styling information.

KeyLines is a JavaScript toolkit for visualizing networks. It works in all major browsers and all platforms, including the iPad.

==== How Does it Work?

KeyLines integrates into existing web applications easily and with very little effort.
How and where you get the data is up to you.
KeyLines does the job of rendering it and responding to user interactions like clicking, touching, moving nodes, and more.
You bind to these events to customize what happens.
Your data stays under your control at all times: KeyLines is self-contained and needs no external connections.
