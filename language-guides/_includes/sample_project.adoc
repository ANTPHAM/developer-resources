=== The Example Project

It is a small one page webapp for our movies database.
The front-end page is the same for all drivers, it consists of a movie search, detail info and a graph visualization of actors and movies.
Each backend implementation shows you how to connect to Neo4j from the different languages and drivers.

You can learn more about our small, consistent example project across many different language drivers link:../example-project[here].
You find the implementations for all drivers as https://github.com/neo4j-examples?query=movies[individual GitHub repositories], that you can clone and deploy directly.
