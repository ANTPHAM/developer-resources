Neo4j might be developed in Java, but don't assume that you need to use a Java client. 
Powerful .Net drivers like `Neo4jClient` from Tatham Oddie showed early on, how easy it is to connect to Neo4j from .Net

// end::intro[]

Members of the .Net community have invested a lot of time and love to develop all these drivers, so please if you use them provide feedback to the authors.
