Technology’s promise is not simply to automate processes, but to open routes to new ways of doing business. Company leaders don’t question the value of MDM technology anymore, but struggle to make use of it to be able to adapt to changing markets. Mr. Nordwall will talk about the impact of new technologies, especially graph databases, and how that is transforming the value and perspective of strategic MDM projects at Adidas, Monsanto, Cisco and German toymaker Schleich.","Language":"EN","Type":"Conference","Area":"US","City":"San Francisco","Presenter":"Lars Nordwall","Geo":"37.7749295,-122.4194155","Timezone":"PDT","Invite":"events@neotechnology.com","SourceTitle":"How to Turn MDM Into Competitive Advantage","Date":"2016-06-08T14:00:00.000Z","Origin":"Spreadsheet"},{"Created":"3/14/2016","Username":"eva.gaudinaud@neotechnology.com","Title":"Training - Initiation à Neo4j - Paris","Start":"6/14/2016 10:00:00","Duration":"8","Url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-initiation-a-neo4j-paris-19994172107","Description":"Cette session permet d'acquérir les connaissances de base sur les bases de données de graphes et vous donne aussi les fonctionnalités clés de la base données de graphes Neo4j.
