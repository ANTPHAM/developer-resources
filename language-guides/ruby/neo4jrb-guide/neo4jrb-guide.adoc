.Goals
[abstract]
This course provides an overview on everything that you need to build a Neo4j application with the link:https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby programming language].  Ruby on Rails is used, but any Ruby framework (or lack thereof) could also be used.

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have Ruby installed on your system.  Some experience with Ruby and/or Rails would be helpful.

=== Why Neo4j?

Neo4j is the world's most popular _graph database_.  This offers a number of advantages:

 * Neo4j is schemaless for both entities and relationships between entities.
 * Relationships between entities are *traversed* rather than *joined*.  Traversals explore the local subgraph meaning that query times stay the same as your database grows.
 * Because of the traversal paradigm we think in terms of the complex relationships in our data without worrying as much how to model it

As a Rubyist you probably prefer tools which are developer friendly and which don't bother you with details until it's neccessary.

=== Introduction to Neo4j

Connected information is everywhere in our world.
Neo4j was built to efficiently store, handle and query highly connected elements in your data model.
With a powerful and flexible data model you can represent your real-world, variably structured information without a loss of fidelity.
The property graph model is easy to understand and handle, especially for object oriented and relational developers.

The property graph model consists of:

**Nodes** which have _properties_ and _labels_.

 * _properties_ are schemaless key/value pairs
 * _labels_ describe and group nodes much like tables group rows, but nodes can have multiple labels

**Relationships** which connect two nodes directionally have _properties_ and a _type_.

 * _properties_ are schemaless key/value pairs
 * The relationship's _type_ gives a description of how it connects the two nodes
 * While relationships are directional, querying relationships in either direction has no associated performance cost

==== Cypher

Cypher is Neo4j's built-in query language.  Cypher queries look like:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.name =~ '.*Matrix.*'
RETURN p, m.title
----

While it's possible to get started using the Neo4j.rb without learning Cypher, it is a very powerful way to query a Neo4j database and is worth learning.
Also since the Neo4j.rb project works by making Cypher queries to Neo4j it is good to understand Cypher as your queries get more complex.
There is also a link:/developer/cypher[Cypher tutorial] if you would like to learn more.

==== Neo4j in Ruby

For this guide we will be using the Neo4j.rb project.  The project consists of the following gems:

include::../neo4jrb-resources/neo4jrb-resources.adoc[tags=neo4jrb-gems]

Specifically in this guide we will be using the `ActiveNode` and `ActiveRel` modules from the `neo4j` gem.


=== Setup

Here we describe how to create a fresh Rails application with Neo4j as the database.  If you have an existing Rails application you can refer to the link:http://neo4jrb.readthedocs.org/en/5.2.x/Setup.html#adding-the-gem-to-an-existing-project[Neo4j.rb documentation].

 * Intro
   * Maybe you've heard about graph databases
   * Talk about what we're going to do
   * Neo4j concepts
     * Why Neo4j?
       * Natural and easy data modeling
       * Schemaless entities AND relationships
       * Faster querying on connected data
   * Cypher concepts
   * neo4j-core gem
   * neo4j gem
     * ActiveNode
     * ActiveRel
 * Setup Neo4j
   * Tabs to switch between fresh Rails app and existing Rails app?

 * Options
   * Switching entirely to Neo4j
   * Using Neo4j and another database for separate entities
   * Using Neo4j to replicate some or all of an existing database
     * Mongo: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j_doc_manager
     * SQL:
       * https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4apis-activerecord
       * WAY OUT OF DATE: https://github.com/neoid-gem/neoid
   * Doesn't matter too much as the neo4j.rb gems don't conflict with other object mappers

 * Usage
   * Cool things that you can do:
     * Realize that you need to add a node / relationship (just add it to the models)
     * Connected data query
