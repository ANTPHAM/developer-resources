== What is a graph database?

A graph database stores records in the shape of a mathematical graph.

== Core concepts

A graph database can store any kind of data using a few simple concepts

* Nodes – graph data records
* Relationships – connect nodes
* Properties – named data values
* Labels - associate sets of nodes

== A Graph Database

Neo4j stores data in a Graph, with records called Nodes.

The simplest graph has just a single node with some named values called Properties. Let’s draw a social graph of our friends on the Neo4j team:


. Start by drawing a circle for the node
. Add the name Emil
. Note that he is from Sweden


* Nodes are the name for data records in a graph
* Data is stored as Properties
* Properties are simple name/value pairs

== Labels
Labels associate a set of nodes.

Nodes can be grouped together by applying a Label to each member. In our social graph, we’ll label each node that represents a Person.

Apply the label “Person” to the node we created for Emil
Color “Person” nodes red
A node can have zero or more labels
Labels do not have any properties
Labeled Node
More Nodes
Schema-free, nodes can have a mix of common and unique properties.

Like any database, storing data in Neo4j can be as simple as adding more records. We’ll add a few more nodes:

Emil has a klout score of 99
Johan, from Sweden, who is learning to surf
Ian, from England, who is an author
Rik, from Belgium, has a cat named Orval
Allison, from California, who surfs
Similar nodes can have different properties
Properties can be strings, numbers, or booleans
Neo4j can store billions of nodes
More Nodes
Consider Relationships
Relationships connect nodes in the graph.

The real power of Neo4j is in connected data. To associate any two nodes, add a Relationship which describes how the records are related.

In our social graph, we simply say who KNOWS whom:

Emil KNOWS Johan and Ian
Johan KNOWS Ian and Rik
Rik and Ian KNOWS Allison
Relationships always have direction
Relationships always have a type
Relationships form patterns of data
relationships
Relationship properties
Relationship properties store information shared by two nodes.

In a property graph, relationships are data records that can also contain properties. Looking more closely at Emil’s relationships, note that:

Emil has known Johan since 2001
Emil rates Ian 5 (out of 5)
Everyone else can have similar relationship properties
