.Goals
[abstract]
This article demonstrates how to style graph visualizations in the Neo4j browser using a *Graph Style Sheet* (GRASS).

.Prerequisites
[abstract]
You should have familiarized yourself with link:/developer/graph-database[Graph Databases] and the link:/developer/graph-database#property-graph[Property Graph Model].

First, http://neo4j.org/download[download], unzip and start Neo4j.
If you have a JDK (Java7) installed and on the correct path, you should see the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd neo4j-community-2.1.1
$ bin/neo4j start

Using additional JVM arguments:  ....
Starting Neo4j Server...WARNING: not changing user
process [70299]... waiting for server to be ready...... OK.
http://localhost:7474/ is ready.
----

Open the URL http://localhost:7474/[http://localhost:7474/] to start working with Neo4j and its query language, Cypher.

If you want to learn more first, click on any of the helpful links show after startup, these are quick slide shows that introduce the different concepts quickly.

* **Intro** - a guided tour `:play intro`
* **Concepts** - GraphDB 101 `:play concepts`
* **Cypher** - query language `:play cypher`
* **The Movie Graph** - a mini graph app `:play movie graph`

Import sample data by running `:play movies`, clicking on the huge Cypher +CREATE ...+ statement, then hitting `run`.

After a few seconds the data is imported, but we'll see only a lonely _Matrix_ node.
In order to practice visualization on more nodes and relationships, go to the favorites tab on the left--indicated by a star--and click on the **Get Some Data** entry, and hit run.

But those nodes only show numbers!
Click on any red node that has +ACTED_IN+ relationships pointing to it.
These are +Movie+ nodes.
In the popup you'll see the node label "Movie" on the top.
In the tab on the right, denoted with an "eye", you can set the styling parameters and property chosen for the displayed title.

Play a bit with the styling options and do the same for the other nodes (labeled +Person+).
The next step is styling relationships, just click on one (e.g. +DIRECTED+) and try it out.

The Neo4j browser visualization is powered by a concept called *Graph Style Sheet* (GRASS).
You can access the style sheet with the link at the bottom of the styling pop-up.

The resulting style renderer allows you to look at the style-sheet, download it, or update it via drag-and-drop.
You can also reset all styling by clicking the "fire extinguisher".

See Michael perform some graph visualization in real time on the following screencast:
